      \ land that was to become Abbeville was purchased by founding father P\xE8re\
      \ Antoine D\xE9sir\xE9 M\xE9gret (P\xE8re is French for 'Father'), Capuchin\
      \ missionary, on July 25, 1843 for $900. Megret named the town after his home\
      \ in France. There were two people living on the land at that time, Joseph LeBlanc\
      \ and his wife Isabelle Broussard, whose former home Father Megret converted\
      \ into a chapel. The chapel burned in 1854, and St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church\
      \ now stands at the same location. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the center of downtown is\
      \ Magdalen Square, which is accented by large oak trees, a fountain, and gazebo.\
      \ A statue in memory of Father Megret stands in the square. \r\n\r\nIn 1890,\
